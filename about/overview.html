  <h2>About This Course</h2>
  <p>This is the <strong>${course.display_name()}</strong> course.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>In this hands-on workshop, we begin by building an understanding
  of Heat fundamentals:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>What are the building blocks and infrastructure an OpenStack
    based setup of one or more servers consists of? This includes VMs,
    virtual networks, and floating IP addresses.</li>
    <li>How do we reproducibly describe all of these building blocks
    in terms of a Heat template?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>We start out with assembling a Heat template step by step,
  highlighing debugging best practices for various common errors along
  the way.</p>
  <p>Then, we progress to more advanced and lesser-known, but
    exceedingly useful Heat features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>CloudConfig resources to enable full-blown server
    configurations</li>
    <li>ResourceGroups to easily deploy complex resources en masse</li>
    <li>WaitConditions to express complex dependencies</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You'll walk away from this workshop with a solid understanding of
    both the fundamentals of Heat, and of advanced features available
    within the Heat framework.</p>
